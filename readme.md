# NodeJS port of GodSpeak (AKA GodSays) originally made by Terry A. Davis.
## What is GodSpeak?
The original program made by Terry A. Davis is very simple and made of the following parts:
* A dictionary made by himself based on his ideas. It contains 712 strings, some of them words, some of them phrases.
* A source of randomness: /dev/urandom which is a file that allows access to environmental noise to generate pseudorandom bytes. Used in Unix-like Operating Systems.
* An array shuffler: gshuf, a GNU coreutil. Terry decided that the ouput should be of 32 strings.
<!-- -->
The original Bash script is as follows:
```
#!/bin/bash
#This prints random words.
echo "$(gshuf -n 32 ./Happy.TXT --random-source=/dev/urandom | tr '\n' ' ')"
```
Terry made GodSpeak for his GNU+Linux machine. Terry liked these random text generators and believed he was actually speaking with God. TempleOS also includes a few random generators for text, bible passages, songs and sprites.
## What makes this port unique?
* I used crypto.randomBytes as the source of randomness. This method will use your system built-in cryptographically secure pseudorandom bytes generator. If using an UNIX-like system, it will use /dev/urandom. This is consistent with Terry A. Davis ideas.
* It uses an array shuffler, similar to gshuf.

I also have a Clientside JS variation that uses window.crypto.getRandomValues: https://github.com/dvartic/godsays-godspeak-clientside-js
## Instalation:
Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/dvartic/godsays-godspeak-nodejs.git
```
## Usage:
Simply call the godspeak function without any arguments to return an array of the 32 strings which constitutes the result:
```
godspeak()
```
